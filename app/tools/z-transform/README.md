- **Educational Quick Reference**: Concise mathematical references with hover tooltips
- **System Property Analysis**: Real-time stability analysis and system type identification

## Robust Implementation

This tool has been thoroughly tested and enhanced for robustness:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management for edge cases and invalid inputs
- **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators when data or visualizations are processing
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and device capabilities
- **Mathematical Correctness**: Verified filter characteristics and pole-zero relationships

## UI Components

### Visual Elements

- **Cyber Cards**: Sleek containers with hover effects and tech-inspired gradients
- **Comic Panels**: Stylized containers with comic-inspired shadow effects
- **Holographic Elements**: Tech-grid backgrounds with scanning line effects
- **Neon Elements**: Glowing text and borders for emphasis
- **Micro Controls**: Space-efficient buttons and controls

### Layout

The tool is designed with a responsive grid layout:
- Left panel: System configuration controls
- Right panel: Visualization area (2D or 3D)
- Footer: Quick reference and visual aids

## Transfer Function Presets

1. **First-Order Low-Pass**: Simple system with one pole
2. **Second-Order Bandpass**: System with complex-conjugate poles
3. **Notch Filter**: Zeros on the unit circle for frequency notching
4. **All-Pass Filter**: Equal magnitude response across frequencies

## Technical Implementation

- **React & Next.js**: Modern React framework with dynamic components
- **MathJax**: Mathematical expression rendering
- **PlotlyJS**: Interactive 2D visualizations (Z-plane)
- **Three.js**: 3D magnitude response visualization

## Test Suite

The tool includes comprehensive test suites:

1. **Z-transform-test.js**: Basic functionality and file structure validation
2. **preset-test.js**: Mathematical correctness of filter presets
3. **ui-interaction-test.js**: User interface component functionality
4. **integration-test.js**: End-to-end testing of all tool features
5. **manual-test-checklist.md**: Structured checklist for browser testing

## Accessibility

The tool includes features for different learning and accessibility needs:
- High contrast mode for better visibility
- Colorblind-friendly visual elements
- Text-based system information for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support

## Educational Value

This tool helps signal processing students visualize:
- Pole-zero configurations in the Z-plane
- The relationship between pole/zero locations and system behavior
- Stability analysis based on pole locations
- 3D magnitude response to understand frequency characteristics

## Developer Notes
